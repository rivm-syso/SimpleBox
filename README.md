# SimpleBox xl_version

This is the branch where releases of the SimpleBox xl spreadsheet model will be released.

SimpleBox is a multimedia mass balance model of the so-called 'Mackay type'. It simulates environmental fate of chemicals as fluxes (mass flows) between a series of well-mixed boxes of air, water, sediment and soil on regional, continental and global spatial scales.

This repository if for files, e.g. in R to handle different functions of the model. First is an R script to better use the dynamic function of SimpleBox instead having to rely on RExcell.

# Dynamic analysis

The RExcell method is depricated. please use R,

See R notebook: [Dynamic_SB4_Rnotebook.md](Dynamic_SB4_Rnotebook.md). And if you want to use 3 different emission periods in time, see [Dynamic_template.md](Dynamic_tempplate.md)
